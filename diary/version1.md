## Thoughts and what I learned
I'm pretty happy with the current state of the project. Through the project, I've learned to improve cohesion and have tried to separate components so that they only do one thing.

Practicing how to make API calls was one of my goals for this stage, and retrieving weather information went well. New things (like Bootstrap) have required research. I have learned a lot more from React and Node.js.

Documenting and reviewing the status of this version phase helps to steer development in the right direction.
